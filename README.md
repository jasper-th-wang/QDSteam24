## Inspiration
Doing tasks with no time constraints leads to procrastination. That often causes lack of sleep, exercise, and socializing time, which can affect both physical and mental well-being. That is why it is important to set a limit on how much time you spend on each task, and strictly follow it.


## What it does
Minutemon is a time-budgeting app designed to help students live healthier lives. It allows users to set daily study goals, allocate time for tasks, and manage their time effectively with the Pomodoro technique. 
It also keeps students motivated by its unique point and pet-raising system. 

With these features, students will be able to develop good daily habits, achieving both their physical and mental well-being alongside academic success. 


## How we built it
1. brainstormed using Figjam board
2. Decided on pitch sentence
3. Listed up features and prioritized them
4. Determined core features
5. Discussed task flow
6. Designed wireframe 
7. Breaked down into basic components
8. Implemented with React, HTML, and CSS
9. Integrated each components to work together


## Challenges we ran into
- Since some of us are not familiar with React, it was challenging to make sure we are on the same page.
- Especially for the beginning of the coding process, Git conflict happened frequently, which confused us.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Unique and fun idea 
- Quality of wireframe
- Quick understanding of new concepts
- Cute characters
- Positive energy all the time


## What we learned
- How to fix Git conflict
- Concepts and coding skills of React
- What students in other majors are studying at BCIT
- How to cooperate with people in other roles


## What's next for Minutemon
- Pet-growing system: users are given points based on how they achieve their goals so that pets can grow up
- Widening the usage: users will eventually manage their sleeping time or exercise time as well
